Overview

This project automates the resume shortlisting process using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. It not only classifies resumes into shortlisted or rejected categories but also provides reasons for rejection and automates email notifications to candidates.

The system is designed to help HR teams efficiently manage candidate screening, reduce manual effort, and ensure transparency in the recruitment process.

 Features

Resume Shortlisting using ML & DL models (SVM, Random Forest, BERT, RNN-LSTM).

Rejection Reasoning: Generates context-aware explanations for non-selection.

Gmail Automation: Sends rejection/shortlisting emails directly to candidates.

Web Interface: Upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) for instant analysis.

EDA & Preprocessing: Text cleaning, vectorization, and data insights.

Comparison Dashboard: Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
